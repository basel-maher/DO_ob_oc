QTL analysis results are dependent upon the fidelity of the data, and
so an important preliminary activity is the careful investigation of
the quality of both the genotypes and phenotypes. Diagnosing genotype
data problems can be particularly tricky in multi-parent populations,
such as Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse populations. In this document, we
illustrate our basic strategies for genotype diagnostics in DO mice.


```{r load_data_really, echo=FALSE}
library(qtl2)
library(qtlcharts)
library(fst)
library(broman)
source(file = "../bin/func.R") # accessing SNP intensities; recoding genotypes
set.seed(94238567) # set random number seed

# omit markers with no data
nt <- n_typed(cross_basic, "mar")
markers_w_nodata <- names(nt)[nt==0]

length(markers_w_nodata)
```

We omitted `r length(markers_w_nodata)` markers with # 0
no genotype data. We are left with `r add_commas(tot_mar(cross_basic))` markers #110356
genotyped on `r n_ind(cross_basic)` mice. #800


## Missing data per sample

We find it best to first look at the proportion of missing genotypes per
sample. Samples with appreciable missing data (low call rates) are
likely bad, and theyll show up repeatedly as outliers in subsequent
analyses. We can use the R/qtl2 function `n_missing()` to get the
proportion of missing data by sample.

```{r percent_missing}
percent_missing <- n_missing(cross_basic, "ind", "prop")*100
```

Here's a plot of the percent missing genotypes, by mouse index. The
plot is interactive in that if you hover over a point, you'll view the
individual IDs and the percent missing genotypes for that individual.

```{r iplot_percent_missing, fig.width=8.8, fig.height=4.8}
labels <- paste0(names(percent_missing), " (", round(percent_missing), "%)")
iplot(seq_along(percent_missing), percent_missing, indID=labels,
      chartOpts=list(xlab="Mouse", ylab="Percent missing genotype data",
                     ylim=c(0, 100)))
```

There are `r sum(percent_missing >= 19.97)` mice that are missing >20% #0
genotypes. Another `r sum(percent_missing > 5 & percent_missing < 19.97)`
mice are missing >5%. #0
In this case, none were omitted.


## Sexes


We next seek to verify the sexes of the mice.
One can look at
the proportion of heterozygous genotype calls on the X chromosome, but
we find it most informative to look at the SNP array intensities for
SNPs on the X and Y chromosomes.

When converting the `FinalReport.txt` files to R/qtl2 format, we pulled
out the average intensities for each SNP on the X and Y chromosomes.
We load them into R as follows.

```{r load_XYintensities}
xint <- read_csv_numer("../results/GIGAMUGA/qtl2_all/DO_qtl2_chrXint.csv", transpose=TRUE)
yint <- read_csv_numer("../results/GIGAMUGA/qtl2_all/DO_qtl2_chrYint.csv", transpose=TRUE)
```

We'll omit data for the samples we've omitted previously. 

```{r omit_samples_from_intensities}
xint <- xint[ind_ids(cross_basic),]
yint <- yint[ind_ids(cross_basic),]
```

We get sex from the cross

```{r get_sex}
sex <- cross_basic$covar$sex
```

Some of the SNPs do not appear to be informative about mouse sex, and
so we first perform t-tests at each SNP, to identify SNPs that show a
large sex difference in intensity.

```{r snps_sex_diff, eval=FALSE}
x_pval <- apply(xint, 2, function(a) t.test(a ~ sex)$p.value)
y_pval <- apply(yint, 2, function(a) t.test(a ~ sex)$p.value)
```


We then calculate the average intensities on the X and Y chromosomes,
among SNPs that showed a P-value < 0.05 after a Bonferroni correction
for multiple testing.

```{r ave_XYint}
xint_ave <- rowMeans(xint[, x_pval < 0.05/length(x_pval)], na.rm=TRUE)
yint_ave <- rowMeans(yint[, y_pval < 0.05/length(y_pval)], na.rm=TRUE)
```

The following is an interactive scatterplot of the average SNP intensity
on the Y chromosome versus the average SNP intensity on the X
chromosome. Male mice are in purple, and female mice are in green.
If you hover over a point, youll see the individual ID and the percent
missing genotypes for that individual.

```{r plot_xyint, fig.width=8.8, fig.height=4.8}
point_colors <- as.character(c("green", "purple") )
percent_missing <- n_missing(cross_basic, summary="proportion")*100
labels <- paste0(names(xint_ave), " (", round(percent_missing), "%)")
iplot(xint_ave, yint_ave, group=sex, indID=labels,
      chartOpts=list(pointcolor=point_colors, pointsize=4,
                     xlab="Average X chr intensity", ylab="Average Y chr intensity"))
```

There's a distinct cluster of male mice in the upper-left (low X
chromosome intensity and high Y chromosome intensity), and a cluster
of female mice in the lower-right (high X chromosome intensity and low
Y chromsome intensity).

There are no male mice who appear within the female cluster in the lower right.

There's one female mouse, `r names(xint_ave)[sex=="F" & xint_ave < 0.45]`,
in the lower-left, with reduced X chromosome intensity. This may be an
XO female. #236


The proportion of heterozygous genotypes on the X chromosome is also
informative, but less so. In the following scatterplot, we show the proportion of
hets vs the average intensity for the X chromosome SNPs. (Note that in
                                                          calculating the proportion of heterozygous genotypes for the
                                                          individuals, we look at X chromosome genotypes equal to
                                                          2 (which corresponds to the heterozygote) relative to not being 0
                                                          (which is used to encode missing genotypes). And the genotypes are
                                                          arranged with rows being individuals and columns being markers.)

```{r plot_phet_Xchr, fig.width=8.8, fig.height=4.8}
phetX <- rowSums(cross_basic$geno$X == 2)/rowSums(cross_basic$geno$X != 0)
iplot(xint_ave, phetX, group=sex, indID=labels,
      chartOpts=list(pointcolor=point_colors, pointsize=4,
                     xlab="Average X chr intensity", ylab="Proportion het on X chr"))
```

The males all show low heterogyzosity on the X chromosome. 

The females all show heterozygosity well above 0, except for the one
mouse (`r names(xint_ave)[sex=="F" & xint_ave < 0.45]`) that looks to
be XO. She's hard to see, but is within the male cluster, at coordinate (0.3667,0.0008)

In summary, we conclude that sample 236 is likely XO.


## Sample duplicates

We next look for possible sample duplicates by comparing the proportion of
matching SNP genotypes among all pairs of individuals, using the
`compare_geno()` function in
[R/qtl2](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2). We use `cores=2` to
speed up the calculations using 2 CPU cores in parallel. The
`summary()` function shows pairs that share more than 90% of genotypes.

```{r compare_genotypes}
cg <- compare_geno(cross_basic, cores=2)
summary(cg)
```

There are NO pairs that share almost identical genotypes.

Here is a histogram of the proportion of matching genotypes.
The tick marks below the histogram indicate individual pairs.

```{r hist_prop_matching, dev="png", doi=600}
par(mar=c(5.1,0.6,0.6, 0.6))
hist(cg[upper.tri(cg)], breaks=seq(0, 1, length=201),
     main="", yaxt="n", ylab="", xlab="Proportion matching genotypes")
```


The majority of pairs share about 50% genotypes, but there
is a group of pairs that are more closely related and share about 75%
genotypes.

In summary, we have no apparent sample duplicates.

We are left with `r n_ind(cross_basic)` individuals. #800

## Bad samples

Our first step in studying these data was to look at the proportion of
missing genotypes per sample. We found `r sum(percent_missing>=19.97)`
samples with >20% missing data. The amount of missing genotypes is the
key indicator of poor sample quality.

Here are the top 19 samples, by the amount of missing data. In
addition to the `r sum(percent_missing>=19.97)` that are missing > 20%
genotypes, there are
`r sum(percent_missing>8.5 & percent_missing<9.5)` that are missing
around 9% of their genotypes, and
`r sum(percent_missing>3 & percent_missing<5)` that are missing
3-5%. #15

```{r percent_missing_again}
percent_missing <- n_missing(cross_basic, "ind", "prop")*100
round(sort(percent_missing, decreasing=TRUE)[1:19], 1)
```

### Array intensities

Another useful indicator is
the distribution of intensities on the GigaMUGA arrays. For speed of
access, we store the array intensities in an `.fst` file, with the R
package [fst](http://www.fstpackage.org/), as a matrix of SNPs x
samples, with the two alleles at a SNP being stored in adjacent rows.
The FinalReport files from Geneseek were converted to fst using ./bin/geneseek2fst.R,
from https://github.com/kbroman/Paper_MPPdiag/edit/master/R/geneseek2fst.R

We'll read in the full set of intensities and take the sum of the two
allele intensities at each SNP.

```{r read_intensities}
int <- fst::read.fst("../results/GIGAMUGA/intensities.fst")
int <- int[seq(1, nrow(int), by=2),-(1:2)] + int[-seq(1, nrow(int), by=2),-(1:2)]
int <- int[,ind_ids(cross_basic)]
```

In the following plot, we display the distributions of
array intensities (after a $\log_{10}(x+1)$ transformation).

In the
top panel, the arrays are sorted by the proportion of missing genotype
data for the sample, and the curves
connect various quantiles of the intensities. Hover over the top
panel, and the corresponding histogram is shown below.

```{r iboxplot, fig.height=6.4, fig.width=8.8}
n <- names(sort(percent_missing, decreasing=TRUE))
iboxplot(log10(t(int[,n])+1), orderByMedian=FALSE, chartOpts=list(ylab="log10(SNP intensity + 1)"))
```

The first arrays show a reduced median and long right tail. There are then a set of samples showing a spike of low
intensity values.

For this particular set of arrays, a plot of the 1 %ile vs the 99 %ile
is quite revealing. In the following, the blue points are the samples with 2-5%
missing genotypes.

```{r intensity_quantiles, eval=FALSE}
qu <- apply(int, 2, quantile, c(0.01, 0.99), na.rm=TRUE)
group <- (percent_missing >= 19.97) + (percent_missing > 5) + (percent_missing > 2) + 1
labels <- paste0(colnames(qu), " (", round(percent_missing), "%)")
iplot(qu[1,], qu[2,], indID=labels, group=group,
      chartOpts=list(xlab="1 %ile of array intensities",
                     ylab="99 %ile of array intensities",
                     pointcolor=c("#ccc", "slateblue", "Orchid", "#ff851b")))
```


The samples with >20% missing data (in orange, NA) have somewhat reduced 1st percentile and
elevated 90th percentile, except for one orange point that
is close to the bulk of the samples. The samples with 5-9% missing data (in pink)
are similar but less extreme. Many of the samples with 2-5% missing
data show decreased 1st percentile, but many look fit in with the bulk
of the samples.


### Genotype frequencies

It can be useful to look at the genotype frequencies for the raw
SNP data. We'll focus on the autosomal
markers.

We first pull out the SNP genotypes. They've been coded according
to the allele frequencies in the founder strains, with 1 and 3
corresponding to the homozygotes for the major and minor alleles,
respectively; let's call them AA and BB (that is, A is the major allele).
We also pull out the founder genotypes and count the number of
founders with the minor allele. In studying the genotype frequencies,
we'll omit markers where any of the founders' genotypes are missing
(coded as 0).

```{r grab_snp_geno}
g <- do.call("cbind", cross_basic$geno[1:19])
fg <- do.call("cbind", cross_basic$founder_geno[1:19])
g <- g[,colSums(fg==0)==0]
fg <- fg[,colSums(fg==0)==0]
fgn <- colSums(fg==3)
```

We now calculate the genotype frequencies, by individual and by
marker. For the genotype frequencies by individual, we'll calculate
separate frequencies for the four groups of markers, split according
to their minor allele frequency in the founder strains.

```{r calc_snp_geno_freq, eval=FALSE}
gf_ind <- vector("list", 4)
for(i in 1:4) {
  gf_ind[[i]] <- t(apply(g[,fgn==i], 1, function(a) table(factor(a, 1:3))/sum(a != 0)))
}
```

The following triangle plots show the genotype frequency
distributions for the mice, among the four groups of markers with
common minor allele frequency (MAF) in the founder strains. These
plots make use of the fact that for a point within an equilateral
triangle, the sum of the distances to the three sides is a constant.

```{r triplot_ind, fig.height=11}
par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(0.6, 0.6, 2.6, 0.6))
for(i in 1:4) {
  triplot(c("AA", "AB", "BB"), main=paste0("MAF = ", i, "/8"))
  tripoints(gf_ind[[i]], pch=21, bg="lightblue")
  tripoints(c((1-i/8)^2, 2*i/8*(1-i/8), (i/8)^2), pch=21, bg="violetred")
  
  if(i>=3) { # label mouse with lowest het
    wh <- which(gf_ind[[i]][,2] == min(gf_ind[[i]][,2]))
    tritext(gf_ind[[i]][wh,,drop=FALSE] + c(0.02, -0.02, 0),
            names(wh), adj=c(0, 1))
  }
  
  # label other mice
  if(i==1) {
    lab <- rownames(gf_ind[[i]])[gf_ind[[i]][,2]>0.3]
  }
  else if(i==2) {
    lab <- rownames(gf_ind[[i]])[gf_ind[[i]][,2]>0.48]
  }
  else if(i==3) {
    lab <- rownames(gf_ind[[i]])[gf_ind[[i]][,2]>0.51]
  }
  else if(i==4) {
    lab <- rownames(gf_ind[[i]])[gf_ind[[i]][,2]>0.6]
  }
  
  for(ind in lab) {
    if(grepl("^F", ind) && i != 3) {
      tritext(gf_ind[[i]][ind,,drop=FALSE] + c(-0.01, 0, +0.01), ind, adj=c(1,0.5))
    } else {
      tritext(gf_ind[[i]][ind,,drop=FALSE] + c(0.01, 0, -0.01), ind, adj=c(0,0.5))
    }
  }
}
```

The majority of individuals are tightly clustered around the expected distribution
(in pink). There are a few outliers with elevated heterozygosity, but
these are all among the samples with highest rates of missing genotypes.
Mouse `r names(wh)` has slightly reduced heterozygosity
in markers with MAF=3/8 or 4/8, but not by a worrisome amount #(662).


### Crossover counts

Counts of inferred crossovers can be a useful diagnostic for identifying
problem samples, which may show an excessive number of apparent crossovers.

We first reconstruct the haplotypes of the DO mice, at each position
calculating the probability of each of the 36 possible genotypes,
given the observed marker data.

# Probs calculated in ./src/calc_probs.R
# Just load the output
```{r calc_genoprob, eval=FALSE}
load("../results/Rdata/pr_basic.Rdata")
```


There are a couple of different ways to get estimates of the numbers
of crossovers. The simplest is to identify the most probable
genotype at each position, and then count exchanges in such data.
Here we use a cut-off of 0.5, leaving as missing any genotypes where
the largest probability is <0.5.

```{r maxmarg_countxo, eval=FALSE}
m <- maxmarg(pr, minprob=0.5, cores=2)
m75 = maxmarg(pr, minprob=0.75, cores=2)
nxo <- count_xo(m, cores=2)
nxo_75 =count_xo(m75, cores=2)
```


The function `count_xo()` returns counts of crossovers on each
chromosome (as columns) in each mouse. To get
estimates of the total numbers of crossovers, genome-wide, we take the
sums of each row:
  
  ```{r n_xo_maxmarg}
totxo <- as.data.frame(rowSums(nxo))
totxo$ngen = cross_basic$covar$ngen
totxo$ID = rownames(totxo)
totxo = totxo[order(as.numeric(totxo$ID)),]

totxo_75 <- as.data.frame(rowSums(nxo_75))
totxo_75$ngen = cross_basic$covar$ngen
totxo_75$ID = rownames(totxo_75)
totxo_75 = totxo_75[order(as.numeric(totxo_75$ID)),]
```

<!-- Here's a plot of the number of crossovers vs the mouse index, colored by -->
<!-- generation. (We have omitted the `r sum(percent_missing >= 19.97)` samples -->
<!-- with > 20% missing genotypes, as these samples show -->
<!-- `r min(totxo[percent_missing >= 19.97])`&ndash;`r max(totxo[percent_missing >= 19.97])` -->
<!-- crossovers, well above the others.) -->

<!-- There is a lot of variation in the number of crossovers, and some overlap between -->
<!-- generation 8 (in red, with average `r round(totxo[cross_basic$covar$gen=="8" & percent_missing < 19.97])` -->
<!-- crossovers) and generation 11 (in blue, with average -->
<!-- `r round(totxo[cross_basic$covar$gen=="11" & percent_missing < 19.97])` crossovers). -->

```{r plot_nxo, fig.width=8.8, fig.height=4.8}
iplot(seq_along(totxo$ID),
      totxo$`rowSums(nxo)`,
      group=(totxo$ngen),
      chartOpts=list(xlab="Mouse", ylab="Number of crossovers",
                     margin=list(left=80,top=40,right=40,bottom=40,inner=5),
                     axispos=list(xtitle=25,ytitle=50,xlabel=5,ylabel=5)))
```
#g = ggplot(totxo, aes(x = seq_along(ID), y=`rowSums(nxo)`)) + geom_point(aes(color=ngen))+ geom_point(shape = 1, colour="black")
#g + scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Paired")

#mouse 50 chromosome 11 has a lot of XOs
#plot_genoprob
#btw max_compare_geno returns mice 75 and 102 with 75% comparable genotypes
#plot_comparegenoprob
We're looking for mice with an excessive number of
crossovers. Mice with very few crossovers would also deserve follow
up. And note that we need to take the DO generation of an individual
into account. But none of the mice seem unusual, in terms of numbers
of crossovers (except for the `r sum(percent_missing >= 19.97)` mice with >
                 20% missing genotypes, which we omitted from this figure.
               
               Here are the crossover counts for those `r sum(percent_missing >= 19.97)`
               mice:
                 
                 ```{r totxo_when_pmis_big}
               tmp <- cbind(percent_missing=round(percent_missing), total_xo=totxo)[percent_missing >= 19.97,]
               tmp[order(tmp[,1]),]
               ```
               
               
               
               ### Genotyping error LOD scores
               
               [Lincoln and Lander
                (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0888-7543(05)80158-2) proposed the
               calculation of genotyping error LOD scores, to identify potential
               genotyping errors. For each SNP in each mouse, we calculate a LOD
               score statistic that measures the evidence that the particular
               genotype is in error, by comparing the observed genotype to the
               multipoint genotype probabilities, making use of the founder strains'
genotypes at the SNP. These are calculated using the function
`calc_errorlod()`.

```{r calc_errorlod, eval=FALSE}
e <- calc_errorlod(cross_basic, pr, cores=2)
```

```{r calc_errorlod_really, echo=FALSE}
file <- "diag_cache/errorlod.rds"
if(file.exists(file)) {e <- readRDS(file)}else{saveRDS(e, file)}
```

The output is a list of matrices (the components being chromosomes).
We can combine these into a single large matrix (mice &times; SNPs),
and then get estimated genotyping error rates for each mouse, taking
error LOD > 2 as a cutoff.

```{r plot_error_rate_ind, fig.width=8.8, fig.height=4.8}
e <- do.call("cbind", e)
errors_ind <- rowSums(e>2)/n_typed(cross_basic)*100
lab <- paste0(names(errors_ind), " (", myround(percent_missing,1), "%)")
iplot(seq_along(errors_ind), errors_ind, indID=lab,
      chartOpts=list(xlab="Mouse", ylab="Percent genotyping errors", ylim=c(0, 4.1),
                     axispos=list(xtitle=25, ytitle=50, xlabel=5, ylabel=5)))
```

There are `r sum(errors_ind > 1)` mice with estimated genotyping error
rates > 1%. #2
There are `r sum(errors_ind < 1 & errors_ind > 0.5)` mice with error
rates in the 0.5-1% range, and these are the mice with around 3%
missing genotypes. #13

The mean error rate of mice with <5% missing genotype data is
`r round(mean(errors_ind[percent_missing < 5])*100)` in 10,000.
#10


### Apparent genotyping errors

A more direct approach to look for genotyping errors is to get
inferred SNP genotypes and compare them to the observed ones.
We use the result of `maxmarg()`, calculated above, and then
`predict_snpgeno()`. The output is again a list of matrices, one per
chromosome, but we'll combine them into a single matrix.
               
               ```{r predict_snpgeno}
               snpg <- predict_snpgeno(cross_basic, m, cores=2)
               snpg <- do.call("cbind", snpg)
               ```
               
               We'll similarly grab the raw SNP genotypes.

```{r grab_raw_snps}
gobs <- do.call("cbind", cross_basic$geno)
gobs[gobs==0] <- NA
```

The apparent error rates derived by comparing the observed and
predicted SNP genotypes are basically the same as using a cutoff of 0
on the error LOD score.

```{r plot_error_rate_vs_elod0}
par(pty="s")
err_direct <- rowMeans(snpg != gobs, na.rm=TRUE)*100
errors_ind_0 <- rowSums(e > 0)/n_typed(cross_basic)*100
par(mar=c(4.1,4.1,0.6, 0.6))
grayplot(errors_ind_0, err_direct,
         xlab="Percent errors (error LOD > 0)",
         ylab="Percent errors (obs vs predicted)",
         xlim=c(0, 1.6), ylim=c(0, 1.6))
abline(0,1,lty=2, col="gray60")
```

Using a cutoff of 0 on the genotyping error LOD score, the average
error rate in mice with <5% missing genotypes is
`r round(mean(errors_ind_0[percent_missing < 5])*100)` per 10,000.
#14
## Bad markers

Let's now turn to studying the markers, to find bad ones that we may
               wish to omit.
               
               
               ### Missing data
               
               It can also be useful to look at the proportion of missing genotypes
               by marker. Markers with a lot of missing data were likely difficult to
               call, and so the genotypes that _were_ called may contain a lot of
               errors.
               
               ```{r prop_missing_marker}
               pmis_mar <- n_missing(cross_basic, "marker", "proportion")*100
               ```
               
               Here's a histogram of the proportion of missing genotypes by marker.
The tick marks below the histogram indicate individual values.

```{r hist_prop_missing_marker, dev="png", doi=600}
par(mar=c(5.1,0.6,0.6, 0.6))
hist(pmis_mar, breaks=seq(0, 100, length=201),
     main="", yaxt="n", ylab="", xlab="Percent missing genotypes")
rug(pmis_mar)
```

The vast majority of markers have very little missing data:
there are `r add_commas(sum(pmis_mar == 0))` markers #74463
(`r round(mean(pmis_mar==0)*100)`%) that are missing _no_ data, #67%
and `r add_commas(sum(pmis_mar < 2))` markers #103957
(`r round(mean(pmis_mar<2)*100)`%) that are missing <2%. #94%

But some markers are missing a lot of data, including
`r sum(pmis_mar > 50)` that are missing more than 50% of genotypes. #0
`r sum(pmis_mar > 30)` markers are missing more than 30% of #0
genotypes, while `r sum(pmis_mar > 15)` markers are missing more than #0
15% of genotypes. Recall that there are a total of `r add_commas(tot_mar(cross_basic))`, #110356
markers, so `r sum(pmis_mar > 15)` markers is just
`r round(sum(pmis_mar > 15)/length(pmis_mar)*100, 1)`% of the total. #0

For the markers with lots of missing genotypes, it's not _necessarily_
               the case that the remaining genotypes are full of errors, but in
               studying the allele intensities at these SNPs, it does appear that for
               the bulk of such markers, the genotypes are not being called
               appropriately.
               
               
               ### Genotype frequencies
               
               The genotype frequencies by marker can be informative, just as
               genotype frequencies by individual were.
               
               ```{r calc_snp_freq_marker, eval=FALSE}
               gf_mar <- t(apply(g, 2, function(a) table(factor(a, 1:3))/sum(a != 0)))
               gn_mar <- t(apply(g, 2, function(a) table(factor(a, 1:3))))
               ```
               
               
               Here are scatter plots of the genotype frequencies by marker, split according to
               the minor allele frequency in the 8 founders. A pink dot is placed at
               the expected frequencies.
               
               ```{r triplot_bymar, fig.height=11}
               par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(0.6, 0.6, 2.6, 0.6))
               for(i in 1:4) {
                 triplot(c("AA", "AB", "BB"), main=paste0("MAF = ", i, "/8"))
                 z <- gf_mar[fgn==i,]
                 z <- z[rowSums(is.na(z)) < 3,]
                 tripoints(z, pch=21, bg="gray80", cex=0.6)
                 tripoints(c((1-i/8)^2, 2*i/8*(1-i/8), (i/8)^2), pch=21, bg="violetred")
               }
               ```
               
               The bulk of the markers seem well behaved, but there are a number of
               markers with unusual genotype frequencies. There are
               `r sum(gf_mar[,1]==0)` markers that show no homozygotes for the major allele. #381
               (These sit on the left edge.) There are `r sum(gf_mar[,1]==1)` markers #4
               that are monomorphic (100% AA genotypes; lower-right vertex). And there are
               `r sum(gf_mar[,1]<1  & gf_mar[,2]==0)` markers with some of each #10
               homozygote but no heterozygotes (bottom edge).
               
               ```{r calc_maf, echo=FALSE}
               pB <- gf_mar[,3] + gf_mar[,2]*0.5
               fg_mis <- colSums(fg==0)
               ```
               
               Further, there are a bunch of markers where the minor allele appears
               to be private to one founder strain (upper-left panel) but show a high
               frequency of minor alleles in the DO offspring. For example, there are
               `r sum(fgn==1 & fg_mis==0 & pB > 0.5)` markers where the minor #0
               allele is private to one founder line but has >50% allele frequency in
               the DO offspring, and `r sum(fgn==1 & fg_mis==0 & pB > 0.3)` #47
               such private SNPs have >30% minor allele frequency in the DO
               offspring. But it turns out that all but two of these are private
               to WSB and reside on chromosome 2. This is due to meiotic drive of the
               WSB allele at the R2D2 locus; see
               [Didion et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw036).
               
               The other two are also interesting: JAX00463240 on chr 18
               (private to CAST) and UNC9169851 on chr 5 (private to NZO) both have >30%
               minor allele frequency in the DO offspring. Both seem to be in regions
               where one of the founder alleles is unusually frequent.
               
               ### Genotyping errors
               
               Let's look at the apparent genotyping errors by marker (again starting
with a cutoff of error LOD score > 2), plotted against the amount of
missing data.

```{r plot_errors_vs_missing}
errors_mar <- colSums(e>2)/n_typed(cross_basic, "marker")*100
grayplot(pmis_mar, errors_mar,
         xlab="Proportion missing", ylab="Proportion genotyping errors")
```

Most of the markers show no evidence for genotyping errors. Only
`r add_commas(sum(errors_mar > 0))` #8537
(`r myround(sum(errors_mar>0)/tot_mar(cross_basic)*100,1)`% of markers) #7.7%
show at least one apparent error, but
`r sum(errors_mar > 5)` show >5% errors. Markers with higher rates of #471
missing genotypes tend to show higher errors rates, though this is
difficult to detect in the above figure.



### Array intensities

Scatterplots of SNP allele intensities are quite revealing about the cause,
particularly when we look at the scatterplots colored by both the
observed SNP genotypes and by the predicted SNP genotypes, given the
multipoint SNP information. Here are a few examples.

Let us first use the inferred 36-state genotypes to get predicted SNP
genotypes, which we then combine into a single wide matrix.

```{r predict_snp_geno}
snpg <- predict_snpgeno(cross_basic, m, cores=2)
snpg <- do.call("cbind", snpg)
```

The scatterplots below show examples of the allele intensities for
four SNP markers. Each point is a mouse sample, and the x and y axes
are for the array intensities of the two alleles at the SNP. In the
left panels, the points are colored by the observed SNP genotypes,
with yellow and blue corresponding to the two homozygotes and green to
the heterozygotes; gray points indicate missing genotypes. In the
right panels, the points are colored by the predicted SNP genotypes;
gray points indicate samples for which the SNP genotype could not be predicted.

```{r snp_intensities_examples, fig.height=15}
snpg[is.na(snpg)] <- 0

markers <- c("JAX00279019",
             "UNC12329705",
             "backupUNC140137407",
             "UNCJPD002501")

par(mfrow=c(4,2), mar=c(3.1,3.1,2.1,1.1))
for(i in seq_along(markers)) {
    mar <- markers[i]

    plot_intensities(mar, mgp.x=c(1.4,0.3,0), mgp.y=c(1.8,0.3,0))
    title(main=mar, line=1.05, cex.main=0.9)
    title(main="(observed genotypes)", cex.main=0.8, line=0.25)

    u <- par("usr")
    mtext(side=3, adj=0, LETTERS[i*2-1])

    plot_intensities(mar, geno=snpg[,mar],
                     mgp.x=c(1.4,0.3,0), mgp.y=c(1.8,0.3,0))
    title(main=mar, line=1.05, cex.main=0.9)
    title(main="(predicted genotypes)", cex.main=0.8, line=0.25)

    mtext(side=3, adj=0, LETTERS[i*2])
}
```

The top panels (A and B) are for a well-behaved SNP, `r markers[1]`.
There are three clear genotype clusters, and the observed and
predicted genotypes match.

In panels C and D (`r markers[2]`), the genotype
calling algorithm went awry. There are three distinct clusters of
samples, but the homozygotes for the major allele appear to have been
called heterozygotes.

In panels E and F (`r markers[3]`), there appears to be an extra
cluster of samples with distinct genotype, but the genotype calling
algorithm classified them as homozygotes and they instead (based on
surrounding markers) appear to be heterozygotes.

Panels G and H (`r markers[4]`) corresponds to a case where the
genotype clusters are overlapping and the genotyping calling algorithm
had difficulty distinguishing them.

## Effect of data cleaning

What's perhaps most important in data cleaning is to identify badly
behaved or mislabeled samples. We have identified a relatively small
number of markers that are showing appreciable genotyping errors, and
the worst of these should probably be omitted. Omitting poorly behaved
markers will have a small effect on later analysis results, as the HMM
to do genotype reconstructions smooths over such markers reasonably
well.

But it's worth omitting the bad markers and checking for differences
in the genotype probabilities.


Let's omit the `r sum(errors_mar > 5)` markers with error rates >5%. #471

```{r omit_error_prone_markers}
gmap <- cross_basic$gmap
pmap <- cross_basic$pmap
cross_basic <- drop_markers(cross_basic, names(errors_mar)[errors_mar > 5])
save(cross_basic, file ="../results/Rdata/cross_basic_cleaned.Rdata")
```

We'll now re-calculate the genotype probabilities.
#This was done on our high performance cluster, only loaded here
```{r calc_genoprob_clean, eval=FALSE}
prcl <- calc_genoprob(cross_basic, gmap, error_prob=0.002, map_function="c-f", cores=2)
save(prcl, file ="../results/Rdata/prcl.Rdata")
load("../results/Rdata/pr_basic.Rdata")
```


As a measure of change, we'll use the sum of the absolute differences
between the probabilities, with and without the bad markers, at each
mouse and marker.

```{r pr_diff, eval=FALSE}
# make sure individual IDs are the same 
prcl <- prcl[ind_ids(cross_basic),]
pr <- pr[ind_ids(cross_basic),]

prdiff <- vector("list", length(pr))
for(i in seq_along(prdiff)) prdiff[[i]] <- apply(abs(pr[[i]] - prcl[[i]]), c(1,3), sum)
names(prdiff) <- names(pr)
```

```{r pr_diff_really, echo=FALSE}
file <- "diag_cache/prdiff.rds"
if(file.exists(file)) {
  prdiff <- readRDS(file)
} else {
  <<pr_diff>>
    saveRDS(prdiff, file)
}

# make sure individual IDs are the same (omitting the 9 mice with >20% missing genotypes)
prcl <- prcl[ind_ids(svenson),]
pr <- pr[ind_ids(svenson),]
prdiff <- lapply(prdiff, function(a) a[ind_ids(svenson),])
```

These differences take values between 0 and 2, with a value of 2
meaning that completely different set of genotypes have positive
probability. Most chromosomes show some differences, but only at a
relatively sparse set of positions. Here are the number of markers
&times; individuals with differences > 1.5.

```{r sum_diff_gt_1}
sapply(prdiff, function(d) sum(d > 1.5))
```

And there are only a few individuals, on a given chromosome, showing
very many differences. Here are the number of individuals, by chromosome, with at least
give markers having absolute difference > 1.5.

```{r num_ind_with_10_diff_gt_1}
sapply(prdiff, function(d) sum(rowSums(d>1.5) > 5))
```

As an example of one of the changes, here is a bivariate heatmap of
the genotype probabilities for one chromosome in one individual. The
probabilities before cleaning are in blue, and the probabilities after
cleaning are in red, and then the two color scales are combined.
Probabilities that are high both before and after cleaning will be
dark puple. Probabilities that are high before cleaning but low after
cleaning will be blue, and probabilities that are low before cleaning
and high after cleaning will be red.

```{r plot_genoprobcomp_M305_c9}
plot_genoprobcomp(pr, prcl, pmap, ind="M305", chr="9", threshold=0.25)
```

So here, for individual M305 on chromosome 9, there is one region
at around 95 Mbp where, before data cleaning, the genotyped switched
from DE to BE and back, but after data cleaning it looks to be
constant DE.

The following figure shows the BE and DE probabilities for M305 on chr
9 in more detail.

```{r plot_specific_probs_m305_c9}
par(mfrow=c(2,1), mar=c(3.1, 3.1, 2.6, 0.6))
grayplot(pmap[[9]], pr[[9]]["M305","BE",], type="l",
         ylim=c(0,1), col="slateblue",
         xlab="Chr 9 position (Mbp)", ylab="Genotype probability",
         main="mouse M305\n(before cleaning)",
         mgp.x=c(1.4,0.3,0), mgp.y=c(1.9,0.3,0), lwd=2)
lines(pmap[[9]], pr[[9]]["M305","DE",], col="violetred", lwd=2)
legend("topright", lwd=2, col=c("slateblue", "violetred"),
       c("BE", "DE"), bg="gray92")

grayplot(pmap[[9]], prcl[[9]]["M305","BE",], type="l",
         ylim=c(0,1), col="slateblue",
         xlab="Chr 9 position (Mbp)", ylab="Genotype probability",
         main="mouse M305\n(after cleaning)",
         mgp.x=c(1.4,0.3,0), mgp.y=c(1.9,0.3,0), lwd=2)
lines(pmap[[9]], prcl[[9]]["M305","DE",], col="violetred", lwd=2)
legend("topright", lwd=2, col=c("slateblue", "violetred"),
       c("BE", "DE"), bg="gray92")
```


Omitting poorly behaved markers can affect the genotype probabilities,
but these effects appear to be rather isolated.


## Session info

Here are the versions of R and packages that I'm using in this
analysis.

```{r session_info}
devtools::session_info()
```
